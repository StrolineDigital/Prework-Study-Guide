# <Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation for making this project was to begin cultivating my abilitiies in the world of programming. I made this project as a first step in what (hopefully) will become a lifelong journey in the world of tech. This project solves the problem of having a practical and organized place to store notes taken during the coding bootcamp. I learned from this project that there are many factors at play when putting together a website and they all must be seamlessly integrated to create a functional and cohesive project.
